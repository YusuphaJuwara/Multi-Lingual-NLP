To solve the tasks effectively, you have to do these things:

- Transform the data (to the requested format in JSON)
- Come up with 'at least three to at most five' different effective prompts per task. One prompt file for each task.
- In the Categorical case, come up with 'Distractors' that are plausible for the context of the question and motivate your choice (, but is this for each single question???). Don't repeat the same Distractors.
- Remember to also add ID to each JSON object (e.g., <\dataset>\_<\task>\_xyz)
- For the JSON and JSONL, be careful about the right string formating -> escape sequences. Look [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).
